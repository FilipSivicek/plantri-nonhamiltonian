This project is a derivative work of plantri, which was made by Gunnar Brinkmann and Brendan McKay and is available at https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/plantri/

I have modified files makefile.


I have created 2 shell scripts - tester.sh and updater.sh. Other programs that I have created are located in directory planri55/my_work.
